# Instagram-Impersonation-Detection
A modular open-source investigation toolkit designed to identify potential Instagram impersonation accounts. This tool discovers Instagram profiles that match a person's name, collects public metadata via the Meta Graph API, downloads their profile photos, and compares photos to a reference image to detect identical or visually similar profiles.
